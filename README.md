# CODE CLIINIX

in a software engineering academic environment, peer to peer learning is 
important to expand the understanding of different code concepts.

The clinix system is perfect in a peer to peer environment 
we use a web based API to interact with the google calendar, users would need to

create an account to login in and use the system.
a user would be able to create and cancel a voluteer slot,to teach a concept for 
1.5 hours(Three 30min google Events).

a different user would be able to join an Event that has been created,by making
a booking, on the available slots
